### Commands

#### gamebot

Shows GameBot version and links.

#### gamebot hi

Politely says 'hi' back.

#### gamebot register

Registers a user.

This command can also update a user's registration, for example after the user has been renamed. The bot notices user renames, but this may be necessary if the bot wasn't running during that operation.
